## Overview
This portfolio is built using:

- **React**: For creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient and responsive styling.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For smooth and captivating animations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Hero Section**: 
  - A captivating text animation that introduces my skills and personality.
  - A video background with a loading bar to ensure seamless transitions.

- **Interactive Animations**:
  - Smooth scroll-triggered effects.
  - Engaging hover states and transitions.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - Optimized for all screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Intro Text**: The hero section displays a sequence of short, impactful phrases to grab attention.

2. **Loading Bar**:
   - Ensures a smooth transition from the welcome screen to the hero section.
   - Displays until the background video has fully loaded.

3. **Animations**:
   - Leveraging GSAP for scroll-triggered animations and creative transitions.
   - Enhances the overall user experience by adding interactivity.

## Future Enhancements
